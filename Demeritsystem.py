'''You are tasked by JHB Metro Police to write a program for their new Camera Driver Demerit System.
The program should ask the driver to give you their current speed in km/h and the average allowed speed of the road.
The program should conform to the following requirements:

    1. If the speed is less than 60, it should print “OK”.
    2. Otherwise, for every 5km above the speed limit ( e.g 60),
        it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. For example,
        if the speed is 70km/h and the location’s average is 60km/h, it should print: “Points: 2”.
    3. If the driver gets more than 12 demerit points, the function should print “Time to go to jail!”'''

speed= int(input("What was your average speed in km/h?"))
allowed= int(input("What was the allowed speed on the road?"))

if (speed <=allowed):
    print("Ok")
elif speed > allowed:
    answer= speed-allowed
    answer2=( answer//5 )
    print(answer2)
    if ( answer2 >= 12):
        print("Time to go to jail!!")
